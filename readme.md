This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Greedy Best-first Search (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
